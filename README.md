This repo includes 3 examples:
* Responsive type based on the font-sizing on the html element, by adjusting the root size (in percentages).
    * Scenario A: 20% increase (`index-A.html`)
    * Scenario B: 10% increase (`index-B.html`)
* Responsive type on selected elements by using a `responsive-type` mixin. The base stays the same accross breakpoints. (`index-C.html`)
